# Advanced Functionality (Report)

## 1. Caching Strategy Implementation

The IAT Digital application implements a robust caching mechanism using `node-cache` to efficiently handle a large number of courses:

- **Cache Implementation**: Custom caching middleware in `utils/cache.js` that caches API responses with configurable TTL (Time To Live).
- **Cache Keys**: Cache keys are created based on request URL and client IP address, ensuring proper cache isolation.
- **Selective Caching**: Applied different TTL values for different endpoints:

- Course list endpoint: 5 minutes TTL (`cacheMiddleware(300)`)
- Single course endpoint: 10 minutes TTL (`cacheMiddleware(600)`)

- **Cache Invalidation**: Implemented proper cache invalidation through the `clearCache` function that:

- Clears specific cache entries when courses are created, updated, or deleted
- Supports pattern-based cache clearing for related resources
- Provides an admin endpoint (`/admin/cache/clear`) for manual cache management

## 2. Request Distribution Across Multiple Express Instances

Implemented a multi-instance architecture using PM2:

- **Multiple Instances**: `ecosystem.config.js` defines 4 separate Express server instances running on different ports (3001-3004).
- **Instance Identification**: Each instance has a unique `INSTANCE_ID` environment variable for tracking and debugging.
- **Instance Metadata**: Added a `/server-info` endpoint that provides detailed information about each instance.
- **Request Tracing**: Implemented response headers (`X-Instance-Id` and `X-Hostname`) to track which instance handled each request.

## 3. Backend High Availability Implementation

The IAT Digital backend application has several high availability features:

- **Multiple Instances**: Running 4 instances ensures that if one instance fails, others can continue serving requests.
- **Resource Limits**: Each instance has a `max_memory_restart` setting of 500MB to automatically restart if memory usage exceeds this threshold.
- **Error Handling**: Code includes proper error handling and logging throughout the application.
- **Graceful Failure**: The application exits with a proper error code if it cannot connect to MongoDB.

## 4. MongoDB High Availability Implementation

MongoDB implementation includes:

- **MongoDB Atlas**: MongoDB Atlas (indicated by the `ATLAS_URI` environment variable), which provides built-in high availability.
- **Connection Resilience**: Database connection code includes proper error handling and connection verification.
- **Data Consistency**: API routes include proper error handling to ensure data consistency.

## 5. Best Practice Improvements with Azure

### Caching Improvements

1. **Azure Cache for Redis**:

1. Replace `node-cache` with Azure Cache for Redis for distributed caching
